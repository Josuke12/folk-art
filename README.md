Assistive Technology
---
The development process uses the **PUG(HTML)** preprocessor and the **SASS(CSS)** preprocessor with *SCSS* syntax. All source files are in the ***src*** folder.

All PUG files are compiled into one file - **index.html** and inserted directly into the project root. In turn, SCSS files are combined into **main.scss** and compiled along the path **css/style.css**

All this is compiled using NodeJS technology. All information is in **package.json**.
